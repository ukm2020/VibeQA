Additional Context: The test navigates to the login page and attempts to log in with invalid credentials. It checks for the presence and visibility of an error message containing 'Invalid password'. Data-test selectors are used for reliability.

Please create a Rainforest test that:
- Uses reliable CSS selectors (prefer [data-test] attributes)
- Includes clear expected results for each step
- Handles appropriate wait times for page loading
- Validates both successful actions and error states
